### A revolutionary typing website, with unique features to help users improve their typing skills.
### Features including:
  * **A hard mode**. If the user makes a mistake on typing a word, they will be forced to type that same word and extra five times. This means users will practice all the words they are weak at, and never make the same mistakes twice!
  * **A minimum WPM for each word**, if a user types a word too slowly, they will be asked to type that word again. 
  * **WPM counter for each word**, how fast each word is typed is shown above the word after it is typed.
